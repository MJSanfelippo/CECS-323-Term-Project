# CECS-323-Term-Project
This is the SCRUM term project for CECS 323.
This is primarily intended for use by my team.


TODO:
- Maybe even more test data?
- Maybe add more functionality for projects? It's not in the requirements, but would be easy to do
- SQL trigger to prevent them from adding a developer to an already active sprint
